    <h1 style="background-color: greenyellow; text-align: center;"> My engineering design process to produce, store and supply electricity in villages </h1>

    <h2> Step 1- Identify the need and problem: </h2>
    <p> I identified that there are regular power cuts in villages due to shortage of electricity and they even lack basic supply of electricity. </p>

    <h2> Step 2-Research the need: </h2>
    <p> By researching I found that the problem in villages is electricity produced is not supplied to villages much because of high end need for cities. </p>

    <h2> Step 3-Identifying all possible solutions: </h2>
    <p>There are many ways of producing electricity using renewable sources. Some of them are:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Solar power &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Hydro power &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v. Geothermal energy<br> 
       &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Wind power &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; iv. Nuclear power &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi. plant energy </p>

    <h2> Step 4-Select the best solution: </h2>
    <p> Out of all these solutions, I found plant electricity as the best possibility as it is affordable, more useful, easily available, less pollutant and 
        does not require much effort. </p>

    <h2> Step 5-Construct a prototype: </h2>
    <h3> 1. Sketch diagram of prototype </h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;" > <img src="pic.jpg" alt="no img" width="180" height="210"> </p>
    <h3> 2. pictures of prototype </h3>
    <img style="margin-left: 365px;" src="pic 1.PNG" alt="no img" width="100" height="140"> 
    <img style="margin-left: 325px;" src="pic 3.PNG" alt="no img" width="120" height="140"> <br>
    <img style="margin-left: 340px;" src="pic 2.PNG" alt="no img" width="150" height="150" > 
    <img style="margin-left: 300px;" src="pic 4.png" alt="no img" width="110" height="140" > 

    <h2> Step 6-Test and evaluate the solution: </h2>
    <p> This idea of producing electricity is proven successful in labs and at test executions. This is an easy circuit which most of the people can understand and
        fix, so that they will not have any problems related to circuit damage. And this is an eco-friendly project which also encourages in planting more tress and
        improving nature by reducing pollution. So, I conclude that this is a reliable attempt to provide electricity for villages in a cheap and best way. </p>

    <h2> Step 7-Communicate the solution: </h2>
    <p> Electricity from plants: 
    <un> <li> During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen and release their wastes and unnecessary materials 
              into soil. </li>
        <li> Because of bacteria in soil by time they turn into electrons and contain charges. </li> 
        <li>If we keep copper and aluminium electrodes in soil, they act as anode and cathode respectively when connected to cell or a power consumer like a bulb.</li>
        <li> We can store this electricity in storage batteries and use when needed. </li> 
        <li> Although it produces comparatively a little less amount of electricity this idea works very efficiently in villages as there are many plants and 
            trees in villages and it needs very less effort to produce. </li></un></p> 

    <h2> Step 8-Redesign: </h2>
    <p> After testing these solutions, I found that my ideas are useful and feasible for electricity supplement in villages and does not need a redesign. </p>
